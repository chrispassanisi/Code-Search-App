Web application that searches all of the repositories on GitHub, and returns program files that have code. I built this app to become more familiar with Python. I want to use it to review program files with foundational code for multimodal neural natworks that can be used as an assistant.

# Code Search App

This **Code Search App** allows users to search GitHub repositories for Python program files by entering code in the search box. 

### Link to Project

[Live Demo](http://recruiters-love-seeing-live-demos.com/) *(Note: Replace with actual demo URL if applicable)*

### Tech Used:
- **Python** 
- **Flask** (Python web framework) for the backend
- **GitHub API** for code search functionality

### Backend:
The app utilizes a simple web server that facilitates communication between users and the GitHub API. The core functionality relies on the **GitHub Code Search API.** This app only takes Python code, and returns .py files.

## Important Lesson Learned

During this project I learned how to integrate a third-party API into a web application. I also learned how to structure a simple web app and make it interactive using dynamic rendering of results with a new page for results.
