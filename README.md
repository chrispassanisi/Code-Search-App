This is a web application that allows users to search all of the repositories on GitHub, and returns program files. I built this app to become more familiar with Python. I want to use it to find 
files with foundational code for multimodal neural natworks that can be personalized for humans.
# Code Search App

### Tech Used:
- **Python**
- **Flask** (Python web framework) for the backend
- **GitHub API** to allow users to search for code in program files in GitHub repos.

### Backend:
The app utilizes a simple web server that facilitates communication between users and the GitHub API. This app only returns .py files.

## Important Lesson Learned

During this project I learned how to integrate a third-party API into a web application. I also learned how to structure a simple web app and make it interactive using dynamic rendering of results with a new page.
